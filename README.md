# Ticket-to-Ride
Ticket to Ride Project - y2022/2023  

For this project, we had to recreate the famous board game "Ticket to Ride".
  
In order to realise this project, we had to follow a multitude of instructions, helping us building the game step by step, while making us discover mathematical and computer concepts such as Stacks and Dynamic Arrays, and even Graph theory.  
  
With this program, you will be able to play a full game of ticket to ride, up to 5 players, the only difference with the real game being that we did not implement the Destination Ticket cards, in order to simplify the program.  
Note : You can change the number of players by modifying the parameter of the function "creeJoueur()", line 83 in the Jeu.java file.
  
To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have the right java environment in order to be able to launch Devcube (Find everything you need in the "Installation.zip" folder)  
Then, download the file ticket-to-ride.dc  
Finally, launch devcube and open the "ticket-to-ride" file you just downloaded, and run the program !
